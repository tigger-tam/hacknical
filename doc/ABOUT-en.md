# About Hacknical

## What is Hacknical?

In my experience, changing jobs, be it when interviewing someone else or being interviewed yourself, is very difficult. Interviewers often don't know enough about skills the interviewee has and some developers with good skills don't know how to show them well. When this happens, there are often one or more of the following flaws in the applicant's resume:

1. The experience on the resume is either not detailed enough or lacks relavant experience.
2. The candidate doesn't have work online.
3. The candidate has no visible public or open source code to give the interviewer an idea of his code proficiency and style.
4. Interviewers lack a metric to understand a developer's degree of proficiency in a certain language.
5. Interviewees may not be able to pass the interview using their resume, as it doesn't give an idea of their character or personality.

Candidates who have are inexperienced can find themselves in an embarrassing interview if they do not have a good template or guide for their resume. Hacknical wants to solve this provlem by allowing users to show their experience in a concise manner and by letting the interviewer easily understand the interviewee's skill level.

## What can Hacknical do?

Considering the issues raised above, Hacknical will attempt to optimize each step of the resume writing process and guiding you to write a better and more efficient resume.

Right now, the app works like this:

- It provides a better resume fill process.
- It allows users to log in via github and grab their public repos, commits, languages, stars and followers to generate a more detailed visual summary report.
- It lets users select between a Github report for their resume, or the Hacknical generated online resume, so that the company they're applying to can know them more accurately.
- Users can share their Github summary report and generated resume at any time.

## How Do I Use It?

Users can use the app as a tool to view their Github summary report, attach the summary report to your resume and generate their own online resume through it, while optionally attaching the Github summary report.

## What's Next?

Right now, Hacknical is in the beta stages and not everything works perfectly.
